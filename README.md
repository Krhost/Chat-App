# Chat App üó®Ô∏è

This project is a chat application designed for real-time communication between users. It consists of a server-side component written in `C` and a client-side application developed using `Java` and `Java Swing`. The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface for text-based chat, enabling users to exchange messages, share photos, and send various documents.
